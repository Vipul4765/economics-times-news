But, having placed near the cluster support of around 22000 levels, one may expect an upside bounce from the lows in coming sessions. Immediate resistance is at 22,260 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.","Indian benchmark equity indices closed in the deep red for the third straight session on Tuesday, dragged by IT stocks as expectations of likely delay in US rate cuts added to investor concerns already weighed by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The NSE Nifty 50 shed 0.56% to close at 22,148, while the S&P BSE Sensex settled 0.62% lower at 72,943.Since notching record closing highs on April 10, the benchmarks have lost 2.7% each over the past three sessions, which is also their longest losing streak this year.Here's how analysts read the market pulse:""Nifty is trading near a make-or-break support zone of 22,000 to 22,100 and 200-300 points move can be expected on either side from the present level. Support for Nifty is now seen at 22,000-100 and 21,700.

On the upside, we expect gap areas formed in the previous couple of trading sessions to be filled up which is likely to take Nifty towards 22,420–22,500.

The Outlook is Stable.The ratings factor in the strong operational performance that the developer has displayed since 2020-21, and consequent improvement in the scale of operations.Post 2020-21, Sunteck Realty has launched four projects including two projects in 2023-24 with an agency-estimated gross development value of around Rs 3,500 crore and has already sold about 55% of the total area from these projects.The rating also notes the low execution risk of these projects. At the end of December quarter, the committed receivables from sold area in the completed and ongoing projects amounted to 2.4x-2.5x of the balance cost of the ongoing projects.“The upgrade reflects Ind-Ra’s expectation that Sunteck Realty would have continued to witness significant improvement in its consolidated operational performance in FY24 and that the improvement would be sustained over the next 12-24 months, led by a sizeable increase in its scale and project diversification as it launches new projects while maintaining its leverage and prudent financial practices,” India Ratings said.The ratings are also supported by strong liquidity available with the company. Two of the projects are near completion and accounted for about 30% of the overall committed receivables from sold area, at the end of December quarter.Given the low debt levels, the repayment and interest expenses are significantly lower compared to the agency-expected cash flows over 2024-25 and 2026-27.The ratings also reflect the continued efforts towards product and asset-class diversification by the company, as it aims to launch two projects in the ultra-premium and luxury segments, having largely been a mid-income, upper mid-income and premium segment player over the last three-to-four years.With these launches, according to the ratings agency, the developer will have products across all price bands in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), and in regional terms, it will have presence in central, suburban as well as peripheral districts of MMR.In 2023-24, Sunteck Realty also ventured into the leased office space segment, with annual rentals of around Rs 70 crore likely to be generated from two debt-free assets of the company.India Ratings expects the developer to further diversify its asset-class portfolio, as it is planning to add another sizable commercial and retail project in the Goregaon (Oshiwara District Centre (ODC)) project cluster, which the management expects to be operational by the end of 2026-7."

Is war really a threat for investors?,"Apr 17, 2024, 05:14 PM","These different global macro events have the potential to create major volatility in the markets, which in turn starts testing conviction and portfolio strategy. We endeavor to treat such situations individually and on merit. Our objective is to invest in keeping the view on balance and navigating short-term pain while aiming to build long-term outperformance.","Risk in simple terms can be defined as that which cannot be foreseen. We live in a dynamic world where global uncertainties become an intrinsic part of the investing life cycle. We have to be on a constant watch for global factors (financial and non-financial) that could have near to long-term implications on our investments. It could be a sudden spurt in crude and other commodities, risk with manufacturing sites, disruption in supply chains, and freight-related issues, destabilizing of a country’s banking system, structural increase in global bond yields, and war-like situations. These different global macro events have the potential to create major volatility in the markets, which in turn starts testing conviction and portfolio strategy. We endeavor to treat such situations individually and on merit. Our objective is to invest in keeping the view on balance and navigating short-term pain while aiming to build long-term outperformance.Our markets are volatile with recent events of Iran-Israel tensions and the potential for a war-like scenario taking a toll. While we do not purport to be experts on geo-political event outcomes, recent history suggests that these events take some time to de-escalate as global leaders work towards limiting both direct and collateral political implications to countries involved in such attacks. History shows that such conflicts have nearly always created near-term volatility which in hindsight, also show up as long-term opportunities.Exhibit I above highlights some war-like situations the world has faced in the recent past and market (via headline index) returns in the subsequent 12 months since the conflict broke out. One clear and counterintuitive trend emerges, that the near-term volatility while being high on fear, became a good time to invest.  50 (the most liquid stocks in the large caps space) has historically delivered good returns post the initial turmoil, much higher than the intuitive “flight to safety’’ asset classes returns as an example.The current conflict could potentially inflict different levels of pain for different economies but the Indian economy is structurally better positioned barring serious oil spikes beyond the imagined levels. Historically, such periods of pain have had a cascading effect by putting pressure on our CAD and in turn on exchange rates and bond yields. But CAD levels are fairly comfortable thus far and the RBI has been holding forth to curtail inflation as seen with the latest print coming in at 4.90%. If the current event does not escalate in any meaningful manner, then rate cuts could be delayed but possible in the latter half of the current calendar year itself.It would be advisable to follow a bottom-up approach to equity investing in the current scenario. The idea is to buy a business from a long-term perspective with one eye on growth and the other on valuations. Investors should position their portfolios to be more inward-looking-to play the India consumption story and capitalise on the dynamics of our country. For instance, explore the Housing theme by having exposure to the Real estate players and quasi-real estate players. The other big theme is consumption and retail, which we believe offers a huge growth opportunity over the long term. Investors can also consider other themes such as hospitality and the potential wave of infrastructure creation that may follow the elections.Tip - Keep a close eye on the volatility of markets, do not get carried away by the noise, and look to take advantage of dips as they present themselves. Deploy cash in businesses that appear strong from a long-term perspective."

He cites a divergence in valuations as the main reason for the decision.","London-based asset manager  Group PLC is reducing its exposure to Indian equities and has made China the #1 pick in its emerging-markets fund, arguing that India’s stock market is overhyped and overcrowded while China’s is set for a rebound.With $6.5 billion invested in emerging equities, the fund has allocated 26% of its EM equity fund to China, while reducing India to less than half that, according to Edward Evans, a London-based EM equities portfolio manager. He cites a divergence in valuations as the main reason for the decision.“The risk-reward balance is arguably stronger for China and less so for India,” Evans said. “India demonstrates fantastic economic growth with great policy stability and it’s often quite a fertile ground for stock selection. But that said, one cannot be agnostic to price, not least in fast-growing , since you do not want to pay up front for those future returns.”Ashmore’s bet goes against market consensus. Almost half of 390 Bloomberg MLIV Pulse survey respondents between April 8-12 selected India as the best investment compared to Japan and China, which was least favored among the three. Indian equities currently trade at a whopping 23 times next year’s expected earnings, exceeding even US multiples, and compared with nine for China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on MSCI Inc.’s indexes.Ashmore has also previously been overweight India, but has booked profits as many companies reached valuations at “extremes” that “ultimately don’t look sustainable,” Evans said. “We are a quality-growth investor, but we are not agnostic to valuation, or to price, and that led us to take profits.”He also cited a risk in India that authorities could look to dampen more speculative investing behavior, especially in the domestic market, making the policy narrative less supportive.In China, the risks are well known, ranging from geopolitical tensions and a trade showdown with the US, to a property sector crisis and growth that’s cooling from the world-beating levels the economy enjoyed over past decades. The main gauge of Chinese equities has tumbled about 40% from its peak three years ago, and is down 19% in the past year, compared with a 33% gain for the benchmark MSCI India index.China’s economic growth is expected to trail India’s for at least the next two years, according to economists’ forecasts on Bloomberg.Still, Evans sees tentative signs of recovery in China, including pickups in factory activity and exports. He points to Caixin manufacturing PMI data, which indicated a fifth straight month of expansion in March, with official government data also showing a rebound. Exports have also increased amid rising global demand for technology goods.Evans said Chinese companies’ shares will also benefit from tight cost management, share buybacks and increasing dividends. Those measures are putting a floor under valuations and offer “a rich potential and a shining opportunity,” he said.Companies in industries such as the supply chain behind AI and electric-vehicle renewables are likely to be drivers of future performance, he said. The balance sheet for the Chinese consumer is still strong and there’s also opportunity in consumer-focused shares, especially in services, he said.Ashmore’s pure EM equity fund has gained 5% on average annually over the past five years, a paltry return compared with that enjoyed by investors in US stocks, but still double the average return of peers in emerging markets. The fund has performed in parallel with the average so far in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

But on Tuesday, when the GDP numbers came out, they were better than expected, against the expected 4.8 % the numbers came at 5.3 % for the first quarter. While this is a quarter number so there can be some skepticism the fact is that over the last two decades, there have been many issues that the Chinese economy has faced, right from debt to GDP concern to shadow banking to property crisis. They all have been resolved and the economy has been able to make a comeback. So, don't dismiss these numbers. The biggest impact of a sustained Chinese recovery would be felt by one sector, that is metals and probably the street has a hint of it and that is why metal stocks can outperform even in volatile markets.

However, sometimes, these concepts are equally useful when trying to gauge the mood of the market for a segment of stock. There cannot be a doubt about how the market has been hit by global headwinds, but if one compares the relative performance of small caps in the last four trading sessions and the one it witnessed in March 2024, there is clear evidence that at this point of time, there is no tearing hurry to sell. While it might be a bit early to say, the way things are panning out at this point in time, the probability of small caps making a comeback cannot be ruled out. The only thing that needs to be watched is how the market reacts to their Q4 earnings, if the initial reaction to results is positive that means liquidity is still chasing the smallcap and why to fight liquidity.

Further, OMCs could be adversely impacted. The war could slacken India’s plan of building an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor as reflected in the prices of railway stocks like IRCON, Jupiter Wagons, and RVNL.","Iran fired over 300 projectiles, including around 170 drones, cruise, and over 120 ballistic missiles at different speeds and altitudes on Israel in an apparent retaliation for a deadly strike on its consulate in Damascus, Syria. Most of this volley of drones and missiles directly fired by Iran on Israel for the first time from its territory was successfully defused by Israel because of the strong regional coalition and effective deployment of high-tech systems built to withstand such attacks. But this extensive onslaught marks another flashpoint in the Israeli-Hamas conflagration and a tipping point transcending a shadow war between two of the Middle East's most implacable foes. The Iranian war has historically been mounted by largely using foreign proxies, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia and the Yemenis Houthis. This shadow war has had three distinct but closely interrelated elements- Iran’s nuclear program, disruptions in maritime shipping, and the situation in Syria and Lebanon.To be sure, this proxy war has been fought bitterly over land, sea, air, and, in cyberspace for a long time in the Middle East. But this calamitous development constitutes a significant worsening of the geopolitical situation in general and the Middle East in particular.There is a compelling need for a sense of balance and proportion. No World War III is on the anvil, at least not yet, and there are no signs of an apocalyptic moment. There is, however, a clear possibility, nay likelihood, of horizontal escalation and retaliatory and even deterrent strikes by Israel.This thesis can be substantiated by the fact that the Israeli war Cabinet member Benny Gantz minced no words when he averred: “We will exact a price on Iran, in the manner and at the time that is right for us”. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged a response that “resonates throughout the Middle East,” and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Israel should “go crazy”. Intimidating, scary words, these!The Iranian verbal offensive was no less strong. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi warned Israel against a “reckless” retaliation, lest it would face “a decisive and much stronger response”. Given such intransigent stands, the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are attempting to contain this war from escalating and devastating the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.Going forward, the stand of the government of the USA is likely to be a major factor in this rapidly evolving situation- a situation, where the cessation of hostilities in Gaza becomes more unlikely anytime soon, a temporary cease-fire is not on the cards, the release of Israeli hostages nowhere in sight and moving toward a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian territories is becoming even more intractable.Given the complexity of this multi-layered crisis, Israel has three options on the table. First, refrain from taking the escalator ladder because of the successful repulsion of this attack. Second, launch a retaliatory strike. Thirdly, this is evidently the worst-case scenario, where “all hell breaks loose”. At this stage, it is difficult to say which option would be resorted to but there is sustained pressure and counsel from all sides not to take the escalatory route. Given the widely held Israeli belief that a nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat to Israel, retaliation cannot be ruled out of the decision-making matrix.This saber-rattling has wide-ranging ramifications and repercussions across geographies, economies, and sectors with volatility in bond and equity markets though temporarily. Bond prices will fall, the cost of credit will rise for companies, crude prices will rise and stock markets will fall both because of reduced profitability of the corporate sector and heightened uncertainty. A sustained reduction in oil supply and consequently surging crude oil prices would raise domestic inflation and interest rates could remain persistently high for long. The disconcerting mix supports the safe-haven dollar and gold.While surging oil prices in the aftermath of the  have a cascading macro-economic impact across sectors that could trigger a sell-off, oil-based sectors like automobiles, transportation, aviation, paints, tyres, cement, and chemicals could take the greatest hit. The market could be disrupted by the war-related risk but hopefully, the supply-demand oil dynamics would continue to be unfettered.The  with an Israeli connection include Adani Ports, Sun Pharmaceutical, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin, NMDC, Kalyan Jewellers, and Titan. Further, oil marketing companies could be adversely impacted. The war could slacken India’s plan of building an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor as reflected in the prices of railway stocks like IRCON, Jupiter Wagons, and RVNL.With crude oil output of almost 3 million barrels per day (mb/d) i.e., about 3% of the global production, Iran is a major oil producer and exporter and more importantly, 20 % of the world's crude oil supply passes through the Hormuz Strait (60 % of Indian crude supply is accounted for from the Hormuz Strait), the crude oil prices per barrel per day could rise from the present level of $91(last month the Indian crude oil basket was under $85) to well over $100.In the case of the Indian economy, this surge in oil prices would negatively impact the triple deficits of the trade deficit, current account, and fiscal deficit.Since apart from macroeconomic fundamentals and the growth prospects of the firm and the industry, the capital market is also sentiment-driven, this war could negatively impact the BSE and  levels. But contrary to popular perception, extensive pessimism is unwarranted. It would be inappropriate not to factor in the strength and resilience of the Indian economy for a comprehensive assessment and perspective.India’s strategically time-tested relationship with both Iran and Israel is fraught with difficulties on the policy and operational front. Israel has long been a trusted defense and security partner. Iran is a major crude oil supplier and has shared concerns about terrorism, the Afghanistan landscape, and the geo-strategically significant Chabahar port. Gathering storms, uncertain times, difficult days ahead."

Under the proposal, Sebi has proposed a special call-auction mechanism without price band for listed  and , whose shares are trading at a big discount to their , according to the consultation paper.  Some market observers believe that the significant difference between market price and book value of these companies is hurting liquidity, fair price discovery, and investor interest.  The regulator said it received presentation from market participants suggesting unrestricted price discovery in these shares because circuit filters set by Sebi prevent market prices from reflecting the true investment value, resulting in wide variances from book value and very low liquidity.  Currently, shares of some listed ICs or IHCs are traded infrequently at prices significantly lower than their disclosed book value. These companies typically lack day-to-day operations and primarily hold investments, including shares of other listed companies.  Despite holding high-value investments, the market value of the IC or IHC can significantly differ from its book value. This difference may be due to the growth in investments in shares of other listed companies, resulting in potentially high valuations.  In its consultation paper, Sebi proposed that the stock exchanges should co-ordinate amongst themselves and provide the special call-auction mechanism for such companies. Further, such mechanism should be provided for the ICs or IHCs only once in a year.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought comments from public till May 10 on the proposal.  With regards to criteria for identification of ICs or IHCs eligible for special call-auction, Sebi said that such entities should be identified based on their existing industry classification.  The entities should be listed for at least a year, at least 50 per cent of their assets in shares of other listed companies, and the 6-month average volume weighted average price (VWAP) should be less than 50 percent of the book value or the pro-rata book value based on their investments.  Once identified, stock exchanges will initiate a special call-auction process for eligible companies with a 7-day notice. This is subject to certain conditions such as detailed information should be disclosed, including overall book value, book value based on investments, and last traded price.  The auction will be considered successful if at least five unique buyers and sellers participate. If not successful on day 1, it continues until a price is found. The session's duration and risk management will follow pre-open call auction rules for IPOs and relisted shares, Sebi suggested.  Out of approximately 70 listed ICs or IHCs, 28 companies have 25 percent or more of their assets invested in shares of other listed companies.  Among these 28 companies, 16 have had their six-month average VWAP (from October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024) trading at a discount to their book value, based on the latest available information as of September 30, 2023."

The decision to hold back crucial metrics that have moved the stock market comes as Wall Street analysts expect subscriber growth for Netflix in North America and Europe to saturate. ""Investors like transparency and the market has judged Netflix on its subscriber success ever since it has been on the stock market,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""To many, it is a valuable metric and hiding it comes at a time when many people are wondering if Netflix has reached maturity in many regions."" Netflix added new customers in the first quarter, but its second-quarter revenue forecast missed market expectations of $9.54 billion late on Thursday. It also decided not to report subscriber additions and average revenue per member from the first quarter of 2025. ""While this is partially a sign of Netflix's unrivaled market share, it also raises questions about the streamer's ultimate ceiling in the current landscape,"" said Brandon Katz, entertainment industry strategist for Parrot Analytics. Netflix's stock fell 6.5% to $570.34 in early trading and if losses hold, its market valuation was set to fall over $17 billion to about $247 billion. The slide also weighed on the shares of peers Roku and Walt Disney, which fell 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Other technology companies such as Meta's Facebook and social platform X too had earlier stopped reporting monthly active users as growth slowed. For Netflix, investors will also keep a close watch on how sustainable is its paid sharing initiatives, Goldman Sachs analysts said, while the removal of crucial metrics will add to the debate. On the brighter side, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese said competitors are likely to continue to struggle in their effort to replace Netflix's business model, thanks to its ""insurmountable lead"". Netflix said its ad-supported streaming plans helped attract 9.3 million new customers, nearly double the consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG, bringing the global tally to 269.6 million at the end of March. ""The bigger question now will be how Netflix continues to keep churn to a minimum, when rivals catch up with their own cheaper plans,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown."

Its target estimates a 2.5% downside over Thursday's closing price.,"Notwithstanding a 5% correction in  shares amid the Cerelac controversy, its impact on the  is likely to remain limited according to experts though expensive valuations may take away the sweetness from the counter.Expensive valuations make the FMCG stock less appealing for  which has a 'Neutral' rating on the counter. Its target estimates a 2.5% downside over Thursday's closing price. Motilal places the price target at Rs 2,400, valuing the stock at 69X/61X P/E of FY25E/FY26E. The target is based on 60X March 26E P/E.Exprt Gurmeet Chadha of Complete Circle Consultants told ET NOW that he would not have bought  even without the sugar news given its expensive valuations. It is not a great idea to buy 70-80 earnings multiple stocks on a trailing basis and 50-60 times on a forward basis where the top-line growth is in single digit, he said. Chadha sees  as a better bet over Nestle.Motilal said it sees no material impact on the company from the recent fiasco which remains focused on volume-driven revenue growth. The planned capex of Rs 5,000 crore for 2023-25 reflects this focus and the packaged food category is likely to sustain better growth among staples, a brokerage note said.Nuvama's Abneesh Roy went ahead to say that Thursday’s correction was not necessarily because of the Cerelac episode and instead was an outcome of back-to-back negative news flow -- first from cocoa cost increasing by almost 200-300% in the last one year and doubling over the last few months. Secondly, Nestle's margin expansion in the near term is looking a bit challenging because of coffee and cocoa cost being high and a 15 bps royalty hike every year for the next five years.While dismissing arguments of the likely impact, Roy maintained that the company has reduced its sugar content in the last five years by 30% in the Indian products and will continue doing that. He also ruled out comparison with the Maggi issue when the product was temporarily banned after its noodles were found to have lead content. After hitting a 52-week peak of Rs 2,769.30 on the NSE, the stock has corrected by nearly 11%. With returns of approximately 18%, the stock has marginally outperformed Nifty FMCG over a 1-year period. The latter's returns in the same period stand nearly 14%. Meanwhile, the counter has underperformed broader Nifty which has delivered 26% in the said period.Also Read:es)"
